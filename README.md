### Goal

My goal is to improve this application as a challenge. And make some mashup of other applications

### Original goal mackenzie child application

My goal with this challenge is to teach myself Ruby on Rails by building a new web app (using rails) each week for 12 weeks.

This week I built a Todo application (Pretty much the 'Hello World' of Development Tutorials). We have the ability to create multiple Todo lists and multiple Todo items for each list, and also the ability to mark an item as complete.

Interested in learning how to build this application? Watch the [How To Screencast here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfWZwsP8trUy5uHJg8gcGIQ)
